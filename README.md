# **Django Blog App - README**

### **_Django Blog App_**
This is a simple blog application built using the Django web framework. The primary purpose of this project is
to help me get hands-on experience with Django and better understand how to build dynamic web
applications using Python.

### **_Project Goals_**
- Learn the fundamentals of Django, including models, views, templates, and routing
- Explore how Django handles data with its ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Gain experience with template rendering and static file management
- Build a functional blog interface with posts and basic navigation

### **_Features_**
- Create and manage blog posts
- Responsive layout with HTML and CSS
- App-specific static and template handling
- Modular Django app structure

### _**Tech Stack**_
- Backend: Django (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Database: SQLite (default Django setup)

### _**Learning Focus**_
This project is intended as a personal learning tool. It's focused more on understanding Django's structure
and mechanics than on production-level features or styling. That said, it's a solid foundation to build upon or
expand into a more advanced application in the future.

### **_Future Improvements_**
- Add a user authentication system
- Enable CRUD operations through the admin panel and frontend
- Implement pagination and post detail views
- Use Django forms and validation
